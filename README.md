Ctring is a C library created for string manipulation.
* __Mutable:__ The most robust aspect of this library is its mutability. With this feature, changing a string or adding substrings before or after it is very easy. And this method gives the coder a lot of flexibility.
* __Brand New Declaration:__ Creating a string in C nowadays can be really complicated without any interface. Ctring deals with this problem in a very delicate way.
* __Miscellaneous and Plenty Functions:__ Reversing a string, finding a substring into another string or even converting uniquely defined string structure to a character array. All of them defined in this minimal yet powerful library.
